# How to create a Book Simulation using only HTML & CSS & javascript:

## Image used from [pexels](pexels.com)


Basic Design for book simulation which can be easily upgraded with any content or features as per your need.

Includes:
    - Smooth 3D transform for all pages.
    - Easy to navigate.
    - flexibility as you can use any content or images, let your mind build on the top of this basic structure.
    - can be turned into a responsive design but I keep the large version only for declaration purposes.
